# Vaccine-Administration
Made in 2021 || Final project of Introduction to programming 

Code made by: Nathaly Ingol || 
Big-O analysis by: Milagros Corbera


The objectives of this project are the following:

First of all, basic concepts of programming in Python needed to be used, such as variables, repetitives, recursion, basic structure of lists, dictionaries, and tuples. 
Then, i had to organize the data in different functions, and create a menu so the user can check the options, such as record the application of a vaccine, search by codeNumber, show the information of the vaccine and other options.
I was in charge of making the code and had some meetings with my teammates to check if everything is ok and if i need to add some new functions so it can work better.
To be able to code new functions i had to additional research and see how i can implement them on my code.

PS: variable names are in Spanish.

When we run the code it will give us two options: 10 to turn it on or 0 to turn it off.
So to be able to see how the main function will work, we'll go with option 10 and wil see the menu below

The options displayed are the following (translated into English):
"
1) Enter the application of a vaccine (In this option the program will tell us if the vaccine is registered)
2) Search by code
3) Sort the list by cost of importation
4) Search for a vaccine application regarding the number of batches
5) Enter an application in a certain position of the vaccine list
6) Show all vaccines with their respective information
7) Store and update file
Enter the option number you want: "
